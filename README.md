# Einstein's Riddle

[Originally seen on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-interview-question-ever/answer/Wade-Myers-2)

	Here's the riddle in three pieces:
	
	Background:
	
	There are 5 houses in 5 different colors
	A person with a different nationality lives in each house
	The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet
	No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage
	Clues:
	
	The Brit lives in the red house
	The Swede keeps dogs as pets
	The Dane drinks tea
	The green house is on the left of the white house
	The green homeowner drinks coffee
	The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds
	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill
	The man living in the center house drinks milk
	The Norwegian lives in the first house
	The man who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps cats
	The man who keeps the horse lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill
	The owner who smokes Blue Master drinks beer
	The German smokes prince
	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house
	The man who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks water
	The Question: Who has fish for a pet? (I would then give them the Background, Clues, and Question in writing and offer them a white board market and ask them to show me their work.)

Typical Answers: Einstein created this riddle and estimated that only 2% of the world's population could properly answer it. Most people completely give up in exasperation and don't even attempt to answer it because they either think it is impossible to answer, or they can't seem to figure out that you need to start digging in and nail down one detail at a time.

The few candidates that are really, really good with frameworks and logical processing, will write out the grid (the axis is often reversed, but doesn't matter, as long at it is a grid) and they will continue to loop through the clues until they've filled in the grid. The reason for the numerous loops is that many of the clues are not useful until you've filled in what you already know.

The Best Candidate I Had: I had one 20-year old project manager interview candidate go to my white board and answer it in about 3 minutes flat. I was stunned. Not only did I hire him on the spot, but within 18 months he was the Managing Director of my entire European operation (and couldn't even rent a car yet). By 22 years old he was at Stanford Business School getting his MBA (I wrote a letter of recommendation, so I get some credit, right?). He was truly in the top 2% of anyone I've ever met or worked with. (He grew a beard to look older because he feared that our European clients would never want to work with a 21 year old project manager or managing director.)

Tips on How to Answer: The easiest way to solve this puzzle is start with a grid like this and begin filling it in with clues:


Clues 8 and 9 allow us to fill in cells directly:


Clue 14 places the blue house next to the Norwegian, and the green and white houses as 4 and 5 (not 3 and 4 because clue 5 has the green house owner drinking coffee):


Clue 1 says that the Brit lives in a red house, which rules out all but 3. By process of elimination, the first house is yellow. Clue 7 adds to this the fact that the owner smokes Dunhills:


Clue 11 places horses next to the Dunhill house. The beer drinker smoke Blue Master, the Dane drinks tea, and Milk and Coffee are in houses 3 and 4. So the Norwegian, who smokes Dunhill, drinks water. And the water drinker's neighbor smokes blend. With the only beverages remaining being tea and beer, and knowing that the beer drinker smokes Blue Master, the second house has the tea drinking Dane:


The last beverage, beer, goes in house 5 with it's Blue Masters. The German Prince-smoker must therefore be in House 4. This leaves the Swedish dog owner for House 5, then the bird-rearing Pall Mall smoker for House 3:


Since the cat owner lived next the Blend smoker, we can see that there is only one slot left, in the German's house. So it is the German who keeps the fish:


If you have a candidate that can solve this, you need to hire them!
